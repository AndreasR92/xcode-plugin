    The pattern to set the CFBundleVersion.<br/>
    Supports all macros from the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin" target="_blank">Token Macro Plugin</a>.<br/>
    For example the value ${BUILD_NUMBER} will be replaced with the current build number.<br/>
    It will be CFBundleShortVersionString + "_" + this evaluated field.<br/>
    If CFBundleShortVersionString equals 2.0.0 and CFBundleVersion pattern is "${BUILD_NUMBER}" then for the build #42 you'll have CFBundleVersion equals to 2.0.0_48.<br/>
    You should use CFBundleShortVersionString (i.e. the marketing version) to provide a public-facing version number such as 2.0.1<br/>
    Keep it empty to not override the version defined in your project.<br/>
